    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h5>Wrap Filling</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 dgree. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Place 4 hash brown patties on parchment
                    and bake until golden, approx 20 to 25 minutes.
                    Place strips of bacon on another sheet and bake until
                    crispy, approx 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>While bacon and hash browns are baking, prepare the remaining ingredients for the wraps.</li>
                <li>Crack eggs into a medium-sized bowl with the remaining salt, and whisk until yolks are broken and eggs are just combined.</li>
                <li>In a large nonstick pan, melt the remaining tablespoons of butter over medium heat</li>
                <li>Pour eggs into the warm pan and turn heat down to medium-low.</li>
                <li>Cook eggs very slowly, swirling them in the pan using a wooden spoon or spatula. Eggs are done when they look silky, have come together and are still a little wet.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat and add cheese</li>   
                <li>Mix just to combine</li>
